# Udacity-projects (Investigate a dataset and Data Wrangling)
Two projects are recorded here:
* Investigating the movie database
* Wrangling of data from the twitter archive of WeRateDogs, a twitter user

## Investigating the movie database
This project analyzes the result of surveys conducted on tmdb, looking at the popularity of different genres of movies over the years, and other features of movies such as the runtime, duration, and distribution of durations over the years.

### Dataset Description
   This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. TMDb dataset contained 21 columns which are as follows: id,  imdb_id, popularity,  budget,  revenue,  original_title,  cast, homepage,      director,   tagline,    keywords ,  overview ,  runtime, genres,   production_companies,  release_date, vote_count, vote_average,  release_year,  revenue_adj

### Libraries used
To complete this project, I used:
*Jupyter notebook and
*Exported as HTML file



## Wrangling Data

This project, involves the wrangling of Twitter data from twitter user WeRateDogs, to gain valuable insights, and interesting visualizations. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc
I used three data sets for this project:

−	An enhanced twitter archive data from WeRateDogs
−	A dog breed image prediction file, and
−	Additional data gotten from twitter API

### The wrangling process
* Gathering data from the three different sources
* Assessing the data for quality and tidiness issues
* Cleaning the dataset 
* Obtaining insights from the cleaned dataset.

## Reports
 * Two reports on the wrangling process, and findings were documented.
